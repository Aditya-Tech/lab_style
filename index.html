<h3>Cat's Eyes</h3>

<h3>Cat's Facts</h3>
<ul>
    <li>
        Domestic <span class="interesting">cats</span> are essentially loners. When placed in a group, they develop their own hierarchy. As long as there is plenty of food on hand, a <span class="interesting">cat</span> can learn to share it's domain with other <span class="interesting">cats</span>.
    </li>
    <li>
        Unlike humans and dogs, <span class="interesting">cats</span> do not suffer a lot from loneliness. It is a mistake to project our social feelings onto our <span class="interesting">cats</span>. They are social to a degree, but they are far more concerned with territorial issues than we can even imagine.
    </li>
    <li>
        <span class="interesting">Cats</span> in the US are said to have 9 lives whereas in Germany and southern Europe they only have 7 lives and the poor <span class="interesting">cats</span> in Arabian countries are even only said to have 6 lives.
    </li>
</ul>
